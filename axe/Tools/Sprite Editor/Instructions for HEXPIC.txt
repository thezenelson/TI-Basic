This is a BASIC program.  Just run it like any other BASIC program.

Arrows  - Move the cursor around
[2nd]   - Invert a pixel
[ENTER] - Save to Str1
[L]     - Loads Str1
[I]     - Invert all the pixels
[CLEAR] - Exit

After generating hex code, edit your Axe Parser program and find
the place you want to insert the sprite.  Do [2ND][RCL][2ND][ANS]
and the string should be inserted at that location.  Then, just
delete the quotation marks.
